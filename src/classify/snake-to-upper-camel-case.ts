 * - CamelCase:         Words are written without spaces, and the first letter of each word is capitalized. Also called Upper Camel Case or Pascal Casing.
 * - lowerCamelCase:    A variation of Camel Case in which the fist letter of the word is lowercase, e.g. iPhone, iPad, etc.
 * - SNAKE_CASE:        Punctuation is removed and spaces are replaced by a single underscore. Can be done with either upper or lowercase, but whichever is used should continue to be used.
 * - lower_snake_case: ...
